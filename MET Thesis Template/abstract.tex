LEGOs have been one of the most popular games in the world since our childhood to this day. Every person, whether a child or an adult, want to express their creativity and show their skills. This is achieved by designing buildings, houses and many architectural objects using LEGOs and trying different designs. In this project, we aim to create an app where anyone can design and create 3D models (mostly influenced by the Islamic art) using LEGOs to be converted to 3d mesh models that could be 3D printed as well as creating a video play-back of this creation process.
